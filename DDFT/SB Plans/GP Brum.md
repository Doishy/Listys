|  **Num**  |  **In**  |  **Out**  |
|  :-----:  |  :----:  |  :-----:  |
|     1     |   Trop   |    Tarn   |
|     2     |  Carpet  |           |
|     1     |  Duress  |  Therapy  |
|     1     |          | Preodrain |
|     1     |          |     LM    |

*Reasoning:*  
Mana constraints are what Tempo preys upon best
so ensuring you have a solid manabase is key. Trop
comes in to enable the Carpets and replaces a Tarn
as you want more "real" mana sources and less Stifle 
targets. Duress comes in vs Therapy as often G Delver
will have a myriad of different answers and trying to 
"Soul Read" what they have on the blind will be hard.
LM comes out as they often retain bolts and add R blasts
and TBH passing the turn vs G Delver is super risky.


**Aggro Drazi/Stompy Variants**

|  **Num**  |  **In**  |     **Out**    |
|  :-----:  |  :----:  |   :---------:  |
|     2     | Hurkyl's |                |
|     1     |  Duress  |  Thoughtseize  |

*Reasoning:*   



**RG Lands**

|  **Num**  |  **In**  |     **Out**    |
|  :-----:  |  :----:  |   :---------:  |
|     2     | Hurkyl's |     Therapy    |
|     2     |  Chain   |  Thoughtseize  |

*Reasoning:*  
They bring in Spheres, you bring in ways to get
rid of Spheres. Pretty easy stuff. Yes you could
have arguments to keeping in discard to pre-hit the 
spheres but tbh they will probably get one in play
and keeping a high density of cantrips and business
is fine.


**Miracles**

|  **Num**  |  **In**  |  **Out**  |
|  :-----:  |  :----:  |  :-----:  |
|     1     |   Trop   |    Tarn   |
|     1     |  Xantid  |  Bauble   |


*Reasoning:*  
Xantid acts as the pseudo 7th discard being
brought in and so once again we add in a land
to replace a fetch as we do not need to increase
our mana count. Duress stays out as we want as
many ways to hit SCM as possible. Maybe LM comes out?



**ANT/TES**

|  **Num**  |  **In**  |  **Out**  |
|  :-----:  |  :----:  |  :-----:  |
|     1     |  Duress  |    ToA    |


*Reasoning:*  
Max out on Discard, drop on ToA as it becomes
a hamper where both sides are trying to shred hands
apart etc. This is either a race or a grindfest.



**Death and Taxes**

|  **Num**  |  **In**  |  **Out**  |
|  :-----:  |  :----:  |  :-----:  |
|     1     | Hurkyl's |   Duress  |
|     2     |  Chain   |           |
|     1     |          |  Bauble   |
|     1     |          |   Petal   |

*Reasoning:*  
Chains come in for Thalia and friends.
One HR comes in because hitting Equips
or Canonist or Vials is fine. Massacre
stays out for Wish targeting and Duress
comes out because doesn't hit the meaty stuff.
Petal dropped because Goblins less good vs 
SFM et al.



**Maverick**

|  **Num**  |  **In**  |  **Out**  |
|  :-----:  |  :----:  |  :-----:  |
|     2     |  Chain   |           |
|     1     |          |  Duress   |
|     1     |          |   Petal   |

*Reasoning:*  
As per D+T but HR is not brought in and
they have less Revoker for Bauble.
