So it has been awhile! Decided to update this after people got too fed up seeing what was cooking and thus having their food spoiled.
Unfortunately the Chef took offence to this and started leaving the kitchen in favour of some weird hipster bean emporium.
Thankfully we have worked out some issues with sourcing ingredients and thus can introduce the new seasonal menu! Now with
a large inspiration from another part of Scandanavia! We also may have had more than one health and safety FDA violation so
are now running more of a Bistro type coffee bar. Our previous menu for those who may not have had a chance to sample it:
https://www.reddit.com/r/MTGLegacy/comments/88mrve/legacy_meatballs_a_master_chefs_perspective/

Starting with the old menu the following changes were made:

-4 Temperature Thermometers (As I said, people wanted no spoilers on any aspect of their food...including if it was cooked?!)  
-4 Brainstorm  
-1 Pot of Cold Water (Less Spaghetti so less water needed).  
-4 Lots of "Please don't overcook" (Turns out people don't give a shit if you burn their breakfast, heathens!)  
-3 Lots of grabbing taste buds by the face. (Aggressive feeding is frowned upon)  
-1 Shiny Meatball  
-1 Meatball Chef  

And these were replaced with:  

+3 Lots of extra mana sauce. (People like their balls saucy)  
+1 Deep Sea Rock Salt (Adds that nice savoury flavour)  
+1 Meatball Platter (People felt they were getting short changed so we added more meatballs)  
+3 Brainstorm   
+2 Starving Men (We had to replace the chef and these guys were cheap)  
+2 Books of recipes I stole off someone (again, lack of chef means I need these things yo!)  
+1 Brainstorm  
+3 Coffee Machines (The extra salt made people hella thirsty in initial trials and the Chef keeps mailing us Beans).  
+2 Recipe Safes (To make sure no one steals the recipes back)  

We also changed the sundries up to work with the seasonal themes:  

-1 Klopsiki  
-2 Watercress salads  
-2 Char Siu Bao  
-1 Distraction from Hunger Pangs  
-1 Extra Meatball Platter (Now on the main menu)  
-1 Extra Starving Man  
-1 Lot of quick thinking (with all the coffee I have been having since the new machines this has seemed moot).  
-1 Extra Serving of Spaghetti  
-1 Glass of Tropicana  

+1 Lihapyörykät  
+2 Real Organic Certificates  
+2 Dark and Stormy's  
+2 Ability to remove foods people are allergic too (after getting sued twice already)  
+1 GroupOn Voucher  
+2 Quick cook Kofte  
+1 Napkin (To clean up any waste).  


Some people advocated to have even more coffee but the amount of caffeine in my life I felt was getting dangerous
and you can only stomach so much coffee and meatballs. Now I am only marginally shaking as I write this so I think
another coffee is in order.  We had already trialled the menu and initial response was positive however a number 
of people expected the Chef to be there and were disappointed with what they had brought when he wasn't.  

Course 1, Kit - Vanilla Spaghetti  
Kit loves spaghetti so I was sure I would be able to satiate his food lust however this boy was hella hungry
and he had rushed out his spaghetti too fast! I had tried to get mine perfect but his was undercooked and when 
he went for the spaghetti, it was all over his sweater, he was losing himself and had one shot that he blew and
you could hear the painful crunch as he chewed on what he had brought. Anyways we cleaned up the undercooked spaghetti 
and decided to try again. This time, as he looked shaken, I dropped down some coffee for him as both of us were waiting 
for ingredients and I just kept finding coffee. I had all my coffee out  and accidentally hit his Spaghetti away so he had 
no Spaghetti and he had had too much coffee so and so he decided actually he wasn't hungry. This overabunce of coffee was 
very much why I decided to not max out on the stuff.

Course 2, James - Hot Soup  
James is a spicy guy who often likes quite well aged meat but today he was trying some hot soup.  I tried to 
prepare some meatballs but he politely declined and I had no way to insist. He started the spice train rolling
and my mouth was very much on fire, I tried to douse the heat with coffee but then just burnt my toungue. 
As James obviously wasn't a fan of the meatballs I went with some Kofte early and he seemed pretty satisfied with that.
Finally I tried to feed him Kofte, Meatballs, Coffee, he literally wasn't liking any of it (I need to get my Chef back!) 
and so once agreed we ate Hot Soup and now my mouth hurts.

Course 3, Winter - Beef Stew with Dumplings  
Beef stew is an easy recipe to go by however the dumplings in Winter's stew are always enjoyable adding some delightful
bulk and new life to the otherwise leftover gravy. We started with me being treated to some hearty nutrition however this 
was not what I was after at all. Eventually my choices were all taken away so I had to enjoy it. Plates down I then treated
Winter to something a bit less homely and despite her best attempts to steer me to the stew she was balled away and treated
to the finest spherical meat and noodly accompaniment. On the final sitting I struggled to get my cooker started, not helped
by Winter's attempt to fix everything red hot however she had got her oven equally stuck and so couldn't commit anything to the 
table as it would burn! I snuck out a few kofte and whilst she tried to think and think and think on what had happened she was
left filled and content!

Course 4, Alvaro - Thai Red Curry  
Another spicy one. Alavaro uses the new chilli layers to get a good balance of aggressive heat and extended afterglow to ensure
the dish keeps on giving. I was really impressed with his ability to keep the heat on despite what happened. We sit down, he throws 
a lot of heat my way. I knew that curry can be quick but he must have pre-made his! Almost full I managed to cool my throat with coffee,
check my recipe vault and find exactly what ingredient I was missing. He was immediately satisfied with Coffee and Meatballs and had 
to be given two lots of Spaghetti before realising just how much food could be brought onto the table (infinite food one might say!*)
We re-plated looking at what I started with I almost had immediate meatballs. His spicy boi helped show me I had it all ready and 
we were cooking on gas immediately, meatballs everywhere with no a single drop of coffee in sight. Delightful! 


* Due to human rights laws I am not allowed to use infinite coffee and meatball generators to feed the human race because "something,
something, ethical coffee sources".


So that was the evening of fine dining and over-caffeination. I enjoyed the Finnish Meatballs and finishing people with Meatballs 
and lamented the lack of meeting Ballin' Finns but overall I think that I had a good menu and a good balance of
flavours. 
They compliment each other strangely well. I might consider changing my sundries for a wider audience
as it is more suited to local foodies but they are my core customers! All my diners were lovely and not bitter, 
despite all the coffee. Overall everyone had a good time and enjoyed much hot, dark fuel however I have yet to sleep
since so that may need to be considered.

It's bean fun xxx
